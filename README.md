# Game Backend Logic

This repository documents the backend logic and system design for a large-scale educational bidding game.

## Overview
The game simulates decision-making under uncertainty. Teams compete by bidding on blocks, selecting production strategies, and managing risk versus reward.

## What this system handles
- Bid comparison and winner determination
- Tie handling and profit sharing
- Probabilistic outcomes revealed at the end
- Real-time score aggregation for multiple teams

## Design philosophy
The system was designed to be:
- Easy to operate under time pressure
- Clear and intuitive for first-time staff
- Robust against input errors
- Transparent in how outcomes are calculated

Although implemented in Excel, the logic mirrors backend system design principles such as structured data flow, conditional logic, and automated aggregation.
