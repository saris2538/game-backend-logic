# Profit Sharing Logic

## Inputs
- Block ownership (single or shared)
- Production method selected
- Realized outcome (randomized)

## Calculation
- Compute gross profit per block
- Subtract production cost
- If shared ownership:
  - Divide profit or loss by number of winners

## Design rationale
This prevents collusion and mirrors real-world joint ventures,
where risks and returns are shared.
